# Frosted Glass Generator - React.js

This is a project I created in order to learn the fundamentals of React.js and Styled-Components.
The website lets users create and configure boxes in order to make them appear as frosted glass.

The project is based on the same idea that was used when I first learned JavaScript and JQuery one year prior:
