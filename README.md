# Frosted Glass Generator - React.js

This is a project I am making to learn about the fundamentals in React.js and Styled-Components.
The website lets users create and configure boxes in order to make them appear as frosted glass.

The project is based on the same idea that was used when I first learned JavaScript and JQuery one year prior: 
https://github.com/ole-kristian-rudjord/Frosted-Glass-Generator--JQuery

Created using: React.js, Styled-Components
